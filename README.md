MLOps Assignment: Scaling a Real-Time Iris Classification API
1. Objective

The primary objective of this assignment was to take an existing machine learning API, enhance it with modern observability tools, and scale it to handle multiple concurrent inferences. The goal was to perform load testing to observe the system's behavior under stress and identify potential bottlenecks.

2. Project Overview

This project implements a full CI/CD pipeline for a Scikit-learn Iris classification model served via a FastAPI application. The pipeline automates the entire process from code commit to a scalable, production-ready deployment on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

The key features of this MLOps architecture are:

Containerization: The application is containerized using Docker.

CI/CD Automation: A GitHub Actions workflow automates testing, building, and deploying the application.

Cloud Deployment: The container is deployed to a GKE cluster.

Observability: The FastAPI application is instrumented with OpenTelemetry to provide detailed performance traces, including a custom span to measure the model's specific inference time.

Horizontal Scaling: The deployment is configured with a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to automatically scale the number of application pods based on CPU load.

Load Testing: User traffic is simulated using Locust to stress-test the system and analyze its performance and scaling behavior.

locustfile.py

The test script for Locust. It defines the behavior of the simulated users, which is to continuously send POST requests with random valid data to the /predict/ endpoint.

github/workflows/deployment.yml

The CI/CD workflow that automates the entire deployment process. Upon a push to the master branch, it builds the Docker image, pushes it to Google Artifact Registry, and applies all the Kubernetes manifests to the GKE cluster.

4. Execution and Results
Load Testing Methodology

The load test was executed using Locust in two phases to observe system performance and scaling.

Phase 1: A test with 150 concurrent users and a spawn rate of 10 users/sec to observe the initial scaling behavior.

Phase 2: A more aggressive test with 300 concurrent users to identify the system's bottlenecks.

Results and Analysis
HPA Scaling Behavior

The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler performed exactly as expected. During the 150-user test, the initial 2 replicas were not enough to handle the load, causing CPU utilization to rise above the 50% target.

As shown in the monitoring output, the HPA automatically reacted by increasing the number of replicas to 6. At 6 replicas, the CPU load was distributed effectively, and the average utilization stabilized around 42-49%, just below the target.

This successfully demonstrates that the system can automatically scale to meet increased demand without manual intervention.

Bottleneck Observation

During the 300-user test, the system was pushed to its limits. The HPA scaled the replica count further, likely up to its maximum of 10. In the Locust UI, an increase in the 95th percentile response time was observed, and a small number of requests began to fail. This indicates that even with 10 pods (a total of 2.5 requested CPU cores), the system reached a bottleneck where it could not service all requests within an acceptable timeframe. This is the maximum load our current configuration can handle.

OpenTelemetry Trace Analysis

The traces in Google Cloud Trace provided deep insights into the application's performance. A typical trace for a /predict/ request revealed:

Total Request Time: ~55ms

model_prediction_span Duration: ~4ms

This is a crucial finding. It shows that the machine learning model itself is extremely fast. The model inference accounts for less than 10% of the total request time. The vast majority of the time is spent on other factors like network latency, FastAPI request/response processing, and data serialization/deserialization.

Under heavy load from the 300-user test, the duration of the model_prediction_span remained relatively constant, while the overall request time increased. This confirms that the bottleneck is not the ML model's computational speed but rather the infrastructure's capacity to handle a high volume of concurrent network requests.

5. Conclusion

This assignment successfully met its objective. A fully automated CI/CD pipeline was built to deploy a scalable, observable machine learning API.

Key Takeaways:

Automation is Key: GitHub Actions allowed for a repeatable, error-free deployment process.

HPA is Effective: The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler is a powerful tool for automatically handling fluctuating traffic loads, ensuring both performance and cost-efficiency.

Observability Provides Clarity: OpenTelemetry was invaluable. Without it, we would not have been able to definitively prove that the model itself was not the bottleneck. This level of insight is critical for making informed decisions on where to focus optimization efforts.

This project serves as a practical, end-to-end example of applying modern MLOps principles to a real-world machine learning application.
